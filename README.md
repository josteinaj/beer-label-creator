Beer label creator
==================

Quickly create printable labels.

You can probably use this for making any kind of label but I've made this
as a quick and easy way to produce some labels for small beer batches. :)

[Go to Beer Label Creator](http://josteinaj.github.io/beer-label-creator/)

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
